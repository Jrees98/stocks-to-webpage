What I want to accomplish in this project:

Get practice with Flask and React as well as pulling data from alpha vantage.

1. Get the base function to pull data on the searched stock ticker.
2. Setup a flask framework
3. Get a react front end working.
4. Hook up Flask and React together. 
5. Have a basic web page where a user can search for a ticker, then the results will display on the web page.
